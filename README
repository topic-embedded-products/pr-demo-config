PR demo floorplan files.

The config file is a text file with on each line
something like:

 4 PR  210  29 110 192

Meaning:
4      = Node index (0..31)
PR     = Node type. Either of CPU, PR, DMA, ICAP, or the contents of a fixed node,
         for example "stream_mux" or "yuvtorgb".
210... = The remaining 4 integers are the rectangle coordinates x, y, w, h.

Create a floorplan Image as a screenshot from Vivado:
 In the floorplan settings (cogwheel icon in right top), disable the "Nets" and
 the "Bundle nets". Under "Cells", disable "Partition pin".
Please run "optipng" to drastically reduce the size of the image, e.g.:
 optipng */*.png
