PR demo floorplan files.

The config file is a text file with on each line
something like:

 4 PR  210  29 110 192

Meaning:
4      = Node index (0..31)
PR     = Node type. Either of CPU, PR, DMA, ICAP, or the contents of a fixed node,
         for example "stream_mux" or "yuvtorgb".
210... = The remaining 4 integers are the rectangle coordinates x, y, w, h.

Please run "optipng" to drastically reduce the size of the image.

Note that the tdkzu9 info is just a copy of the 7030 for now, to be fixed soon.
